This repository contains an early-stage library for implementing deterministic simulation testing for Java, drawing inspiration from the FoundationDB and TigerBeetle projects. The goal is to enable mostly idiomatic Java code to be tested deterministically.

Despite its many advantages, deterministic simulation is not widely adopted because most programming languages cannot easily switch to deterministic execution. As a result, libraries and codebases must actively avoid non-deterministic language features and dependencies to be able to deterministic simulation testing. However, with the introduction of virtual threads in Java, it is now possible to control the execution order at a much lower level, making deterministic testing significantly more practical in Java.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JVM Garbage Collection | Pause and cause thread reorder beyond what we can simulate.                                                                                | Ignore         | It doesn't have a huge effect in the future its possible to implement a GC though.                                                                                 |
| JIT  | Can change instruction ordering at runtime and cause very subtle bugs in multithreaded applications see JCStress project for more details. | Ignore/Disable | Disable it or turn it down during simulation if it is causing issues and leave that state space testing to tools like JCStress.                                    |
| Classloading  | Since it has to reads the file system.                                                                                                     | Ignore         | Classloading doesn't happen during runtime all that often so we can ignore it.                                                                                     |
| volatile| Since interlieved updates to volitile variables can't be simulated.                                                                        | Ignore/Avoid   | Specifically avoid mutable volatile usage int, float, double, and long. Boolean and Immutable objects are okay.                                                    |
| Thread.sleep()| Since it sleeps based system time.                                                                                                         | TBD            | Possibly replace usage with a proxy that uses simulation clock when run simulation.                                                                                |

Use new java time api with respective .now(clock) methods instead.                    |
| LocalDate.now(), LocalTime.now(), Instant.now(), LocalDateTime.now(), ZoneDateTime.now() | Returns values based on system time.                                                                                                       | Instrument     | Anything that can control logic will need to be replaced by something that can have the clock replaced e.g. Instant.now(Clock).                                    |
| Thread.ofPlatform(), ThreadPoolExecutor or Thread.ofVirtual() | Can only control interleaving of threads with virtual threads.                                                                             | Instrument     | Replace with SchedulableVirtualThreadFactory during simulation, Requires Java 24 or higher.                                                                        |

From the above table, any dependency that uses a line with Alternative/Instrument/Not Supported will have to be modified or stubbed out to support deterministic simulation testing of a given system. With the hope that simple changes can be made in order for a lot of java libraries able to be used while doing deterministic simulation testing in the future.
